since we are using using Helm, there is no need for a separate kubernetes/ folder because:

Helm already manages Kubernetes manifests inside the helm/chart/templates/ folder.
 You can deploy everything with a single helm install command.
 Helm allows dynamic templating, making it more flexible than static YAML files.
